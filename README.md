This is the repository for the materials, homework and other files for the Regression class, almost all the examples that I will deposit here are examples using Rcode in my GitHub account and some Rmarkdown versions of them. The course material in general is based ("loosely based") on the book: F.E. Harrel. This book is part of the Springer Collection in Using R. Using a net connection inside the UNAM, you can download the book's pdf or e-Book for free. For the coursework is mandatory that you use R and highly recommended that you use RStudio, for turning in your homework and projects it is recommended to use Rmarkdown.  
Examples and exercises also come from Daniel's book in Biostatistics.  The CAR Book (car R library) is very much used as examples too, the R package is in the Comprehensive R Archive Nerwork (CRAN), car (and carData), we use the subroutines all over in my code.  All the books in the bibliography are quite good and usefull and full of detailed exampes. 
The Rmarkdown examples are formatted to edit the WEB pages for the class. You to copy the R code to the console (or clone the repo and in your system run in the Rmarkdown) and run the examples, you can play with the code and experiment with different parameters and ideas, and then to generate your own R code. I will try to keep the repository formatted, nevertheless I cannot be sure if I will.
