## Introduction  
This is the repository for the materials, homework and other files for the Regression class, almost all the examples that I will deposit here are examples using R and you can find some in my GitHub account and some Rmarkdown versions of them. These pages contain some solved problems and advanced examples from statistics and different regression models, many examples are taken from the Daniel's Biostatistics for the first subjects, nevertheless the problems for different regression models are taken from the more advanced books. All the examples are solved using R ([CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/))and different R packages, running over [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/), the idea is to use this site as support of the course I teach at UNAM. If you need a refreshment in general statistics you can check my undergraduate [statistics course](https://fabarrios.github.io/ProbEstad/) in the WEB.  I also have some [notes](https://fabarrios.github.io/AdvExamples/Notes/Notes) that have links to different pages and very useful material. For the problems presented here I started with some t-test, ANOVA and regression examples. Then we will continue with more complex ideas.  

## Program  
I Data manipulation in R  
1. Tidyverse, tibbles  
3. Pipe, filters, functions (on tibbles)  
4. ggplot  

II Introduction  
1. t-Test  
2. ANOVA  
3. Regression  

III Multiple Linear Regression  

IV Logistic Regression  

V Survival Analysis  

VI Maximum Likelihood Estimation


## Data visualization  
After loading data in R, the first step is to understand the structure of and format the data is, and restructure its order if needed to use the 
different R functions and the needed libraries, for the *post hoc* analysis.
