1. For the fitted logistic regression model in Table 5.6, calculate the log odds for a 60-year-old smoker with cholesterol, 
SBP, and BMI values of 250 mg/dL, 150 mmHg, and 20, respectively. Now calculate the log odds for an individual with a 
cholesterol level of 200 mg/dL, holding the values of the other predictors fixed. Use these two calculations to estimate 
an odds ratio associated with a 50 mg/dL increase in cholesterol. Repeat the above calculations for a 70-year-old individual 
with identical values of the other predictors. Comment on any differences between the two estimated odds ratios.
